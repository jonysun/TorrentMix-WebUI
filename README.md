---

A third-party downloader WebUI that works with both **qBittorrent** (WebAPI v2, v3.2.0+) and **Transmission** (RPC, all versions) — from a single codebase.

The core goal is simple: **don't make deployment a pain**. The repo ships four distribution formats so you can pick whatever fits your setup.

## Features

- 🔍 **Auto-detect backend** — Identifies qBittorrent or Transmission on startup, no manual config needed
- 🌉 **Adapter normalization** — UI never touches backend-specific types; all data flows through a unified model
- ⚡ **Virtual scrolling** — Powered by `@tanstack/vue-virtual`, handles thousands of torrents without breaking a sweat
- 🔐 **Secure auth** — qB cookie session; Transmission Basic Auth with automatic 409 Session-Id handshake
- 📱 **Mobile-responsive** — Tailwind breakpoints + touch-friendly layout
- 🚀 **Incremental sync** — Uses qBittorrent `sync/maindata` RID to minimize bandwidth
- 🛡️ **Circuit breaker & backoff** — Exponential retry on failure, auto-resume on reconnect

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| Framework | Vue 3 · TypeScript · Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS · Shadcn Vue |
| State | Pinia · `shallowRef<Map>` for high-throughput storage |
| Network | Axios · custom interceptors |
| Performance | @tanstack/vue-virtual · Fuse.js |

## Getting Started

> **Quickest path (Zip):** Download `dist.zip` from [Releases](../../releases/latest), extract it into your backend's WebUI directory — done. No build step required.

### Docker (Standalone — most stable)

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8888:8080 \
  -e TORRENTMIX_DB_KEY='replace-with-a-long-random-string' \
  -v torrentmix-catalog:/config \
  yunfeng86/torrentmix-webui
```

Then open `http://localhost:8888` and add your first backend in **Switch Server → Manage Servers**. See [deploy/standalone-service/README.md](deploy/standalone-service/README.md) for full options.

## Deployment

Pick the distribution format that fits your setup:

| Mode | Best for | Artifact |
|------|----------|----------|
| **A. Loader** | Drop one file in, auto-update from a release host | `loader.html` |
| **B. Standalone** | Dedicated port / Docker, multi-instance, most reliable | Docker image / binary |
| **C. Sidecar** | No extra port; an external process overwrites the WebUI directory | `updater.mjs` |
| **D. Dist (Zip)** | Air-gapped / LAN — download one zip and extract | `dist.zip` |

### A. Loader

Rename `loader.html` to `index.html` and place it in the backend WebUI directory. On load it fetches `latest.json`, then loads the correct JS/CSS bundle via `manifest.json` (SRI-verified). Future upgrades happen automatically — no file replacement needed.

```
# Pin to a specific version (optional)
?ver=0.1.0   or   ?tag=v0.1.0
```

You can also pin/unpin a version in the Loader page (stored in `localStorage`). Admins may drop a `config.json` next to `index.html`:

```json
{ "latestUrl": "https://YOUR.DOMAIN/latest.json", "pinnedVersion": "0.1.0" }
```

Priority: URL params (`?ver`) > browser pin (`localStorage`) > `config.json`.

Release contract:

- `release.path`, `release.manifest`, `release.loader`, and `release.distZip` inside `latest.json` stay relative so the same publish output can be reused across self-hosted sources, mirrors, and `gh-pages`.
- Loader tries an explicit query-supplied source before browser-saved values, `config.json`, and built-in defaults.
- Entry JS/CSS from `manifest.json` are resolved relative to the manifest URL and keep `integrity` metadata when present.

> ⚠️ This mode inherently trusts the remote script host. Only use it with a release source you control.

### B. Standalone

The WebUI static files and reverse-proxy gateway share the same origin, eliminating CORS issues. Supports managing multiple backend instances and stores the runtime catalog in an encrypted SQLCipher database.

- Docker: [deploy/standalone-service/](deploy/standalone-service/)
- Binary: [rust/apps/standalone-service/](rust/apps/standalone-service/)

### C. Sidecar

Periodically fetches `dist.zip` from a release host, verifies SHA-256, and extracts it into the target directory.

```bash
LATEST_URL=https://your-release-host/latest.json \
TARGET_DIR=/path/to/webui \
CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC=3600 \
node deploy/sidecar/updater.mjs
```

Sidecar contract:

- `LATEST_URL` must point to a `latest.json` that exposes `release.distZip`; if `release.distZipSha256` is present, Sidecar enforces it.
- Sidecar only replaces the target directory after checksum verification succeeds and the extracted archive contains `index.html` at the archive root.
- If verification fails or the archive layout is invalid, the existing target directory is left untouched.

### D. Dist (Zip)

Download `dist.zip` from Releases, extract it into the qBittorrent or Transmission WebUI directory, and refresh.

The `dist.zip` contract guarantees that `index.html` and its referenced assets live at the archive root, with no extra wrapper directory to strip first.

> ⚠️ Opening via `file://` won't work (browser security restrictions). It must be served by the backend or a reverse proxy.

## Local Development

**Requirements:** Node.js 20+ (tests require Node.js 22.6+, CI uses Node.js 24), pnpm 10+ (via Corepack recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YunFeng86/TorrentMix-WebUI.git
cd TorrentMix-WebUI
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Vite dev proxy is pre-configured in [vite.config.ts](vite.config.ts):

```
qBittorrent   /api/*           → http://localhost:8080
Transmission  /transmission/*  → http://localhost:9091
```

### Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev           # Start dev server
pnpm build         # Production build (static assets)
pnpm build:publish # Multi-artifact build for releases
pnpm test          # Run test suite (Node.js 22.6+)
pnpm lint          # ESLint
pnpm preview       # Preview production build locally
```

### Release Build

```bash
pnpm build:publish
```

Outputs to `artifacts/publish/`:

```
artifacts/publish/
├── latest.json              # Version pointer (latest release, relative release refs)
├── manifest.json            # File hashes + entrypoint
├── loader.html              # Auto-updating loader (stable URL)
└── releases/
    └── <version>/
        ├── dist.zip         # Offline payload bundle (direct-install root + SHA-256)
        └── ...
```

## CI/CD

Powered by GitHub Actions ([`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)).

Push a tag (e.g. `v0.1.0`) to trigger:

1. Run tests & build
2. Generate multi-artifact release directory
3. Run distribution-contract smoke checks against those artifacts
4. Create GitHub Release and upload artifacts
5. Sync `latest.json` + `releases/<version>/` to the `gh-pages` branch

## Contributing

PRs and issues are welcome! Before submitting:

1. Read [Claude.md](Claude.md) for architecture conventions (Adapter / Network / State / View layer boundaries)
2. Make sure `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` pass
3. Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.)
4. Include screenshots or GIFs for UI changes
